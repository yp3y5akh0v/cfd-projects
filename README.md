Various simulations of fluid flow problems

Repo contains 2D/3D simulations written in *Matlab* and it is based on *Navier Stokes equation*. 
Each sub project has mp4 video file which runs 60 fps (chose this option to provide smooth graphical 
representation of problem). Some of simulations might not be very fast but it would be great if you have any ideas on how 
optimize code and increase performance.
